The IDE I chose to use is Visual Studio Code. While technically a code editor and not an IDE, VSCode is praised for its flexibility and exntensibility. It has a quick and easy to use interface and allows for a usability by both beginners and experience coders. Additionally, I already had it installed on my system and is a program that I haven't yet used but have wanted to try out for some time. To be honest, I also want to try IntelliJ IDEA, but I will stick with VSCode for now. It seems like a program that will help me transition from a novice coder to a more intermediate and experienced coder.
