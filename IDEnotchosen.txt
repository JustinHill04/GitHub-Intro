One application I didn't choose is BlueJ. I didn't choose this IDE 
because it scored pretty low on both user rating and user satisfaction 
according to softwaretestinghelp.com. With this, it also doesn't seem
to have an easy learning curve to potentially attract its usage. Although
it is listen as a good option for beginners, it lacks features for bigger
applications
