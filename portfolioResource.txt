GitHub will allow me to upload projects I have worked on, allowing future employers to see what skills I have developed. It will not only allow me to showcase my technical skills, but also my abilty with version control and collaboration tools. Not only will it allow me to show my finished products, but also the process behind them. Potential employers can see my coding style, building process, and even showcase documentation practices. It allows for more insight into my thinking compared to simply a finished product portfolio.
With the field I plan on getting into, it is important to have work to speak for. Having a GitHub portfolio can potentially set me apart from my peers and catch the eyes of employers. GitHub will help for me to put relevant projects and abilities on display and all in all provide a deeper look into me and my skills.
